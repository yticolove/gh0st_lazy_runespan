# Endlessly Runespans!

## Requirements

Before you begin, make sure of the following:
- Your backpack is open on the screen.

## Steps

To embark on your botting adventure, please follow these steps carefully:

1. **Navigate to your desired runespan island.**
   - Choose the island you wish to siphon and make your way there.

2. **Center your character.**
   - Try to center your character as best as you can on the island. This ensures optimal engagement with the environment.

3. **Set your location.**
   - Click 'Set Location' in the settings panel to mark your current position.

4. **Adjust your range.**
   - Adjust your `x_range` (east/west) and `y_range` (north/south) settings to define the area you wish to cover.
   - **Important:** Ensure your range will not cross over into another runespan island to avoid unexpected transitions.
